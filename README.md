# SandAndStonesNES

SandAndStonesNES is a NES emulator project. It aims to emulate the Nintendo Entertainment System, including CPU, PPU, APU, memory, and basic cartridge mappers, with a modular architecture and a modern frontend.

## Features Planned
- NES CPU, PPU, and APU emulation
- Cartridge and memory mappers
- Joypad input
- Renderer for video output
- Modular backend and frontend structure
- Frontend built with Next.js

### Backend (Python Emulator)
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```
5. Run the emulator:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend (Next.js)
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
